Mission Techies: in-class challenge (11/7/19)

*Question to answer: how many cars do I have that were built between 1940 and 1960?

*Steps to take to solve challenge/answer question:

1.) Create a loop that iterates over the cars array.
2.) Create a conditional inside of the loop that answers true or false.
3.) The conditional will test if the year is greater than 1940 and less than 1960.
4.) If true, a counter will increase by one. 
5.) Finally, we will return the counter's value.
